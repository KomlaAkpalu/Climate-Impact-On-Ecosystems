# Climate-Impact-On-Ecosystems

## Overview
This repository hosts the "Climate Impact on Ecosystems" project, which explores the effects of climate and management practices on ecosystems through detailed statistical analysis. It focuses on the relationship between annual net primary production (ANPP) and microbial diversity, assessing how factors such as temperature and forest management influence ecological dynamics.

## Datasets
The project uses two primary datasets:
- `annual_production.csv` - Contains data on ANPP and annual temperature across various sites.
- `microbial_diversity.csv` - Provides data on microbial diversity, including fungal richness and soil temperature across different grassland types.

## Analysis Performed
The project includes:
1. **Linear Regression Analysis** of ANPP against annual temperature to determine the influence of temperature on ecological productivity.
2. **Kruskal-Wallis Test** to compare log-transformed ANPP between managed and unmanaged forests.
3. Analysis of **Fungal Richness** versus soil temperature, to explore how microbial communities respond to temperature variations.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`:
  - `annual_production.csv`
  - `microbial_diversity.csv`
- `/scripts`:
  - `R_Script.R` - Contains the R code used for the analyses.
- `/docs`:
  - `Data_Analysis_Report.pdf` - Detailed report of the findings and visualizations.

## Visualizations
Included are several plots demonstrating the ecological impacts studied:
- Relationship between ANPP and temperature.
- Effect of forest management on ANPP.
- Variation of fungal richness with soil temperature.

## Usage
To run this analysis:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and required libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`).
3. Set the working directory in R to this repository's root.
4. Execute the script `scripts/R_Script.R`.

## Conclusion
The analyses conducted reveal significant insights into how environmental factors like temperature and forest management impact ecological productivity and microbial diversity. Key findings include a positive correlation between ANPP and temperature, and varied responses of fungal richness to soil temperature across different grasslands. These results are crucial for understanding ecosystem responses to climate variability and can inform conservation strategies.
